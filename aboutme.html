    <h3>Hi, I am Kellie Monzon Cruz.</h3>
<p>
    I am currently a 2nd-year Computational Media major with threads in Media and Interaction Design at the
    Georgia Institute of Technology. I chose to study Computational Media because it combined two of my
    interests into a single area of study. I am fascinated by technology and how it can aid in the understanding
    of complex ideas, topics, and information. I am passionate about making a connections with people and the
    world around me through technology.

    With my parents being from El Salvador and Guatemala, I frequently found myself traveling to both countries
    growing up. I was exposed to beautiful views, culture, and people from a young age. My growing love for my
    culture has influenced me to incorporate it into my design solutions in one way or another. Additionally, I
    have always been very close to my family and I like to dedicate a lot of my work to them because of
    their support throughout my life. A special thanks goes out to everyone who has always supported me.
